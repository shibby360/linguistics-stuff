# Verbs
Verbs are very simple. The infinitive contains "ak" at the beginning, and the endings are listed below.
| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person |  | -(o)m |
| 2nd person | -(e)f | -(o)n |
| 3rd person | -(i)h | -(i)r |

Example:  
Verb chart for **ak het**(_to be_)
| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1p | A het | Nom hetom |
| 2p | Tyo hetef | Vyo heton |
| 3p | Lil hetih/Ei hetih | Eil hetir |

Only add the vowel if the stem ends in a consonant.  
Example where stem ends in a vowel:
Verb chart for **ak ponde**(_to think_)
| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1p | A ponde | Nom pondem |
| 2p | Tyo pondef | Vyo ponden |
| 3p | Lil pondeh/Ei pondeh | Eil ponder |

All these directly mean "_Pronoun verb(s)_" or "_Pronoun_ do(es) _verbs(s)_", but what if you need -ing or the command?
| Usage | Translation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -ing | -(l)an | **A pondelan**(_I am thinking_) |
| command | -(t)a | **Vyicha!**(_Wish!_) |

Add the consonant if the stem ends in a vowel.
