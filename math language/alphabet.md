# alphabet
the math language is party english-encoded, so the root words are just english words

a letter corresponds to it's index in the alphabet, so "a" is 1, "b" is 2, etc. letters are seperated with $*$, a multiplication symbol. if something about the the multiplication is unclear/interfering with something else, then put parentheses around the word.

examples:  
heat = $(8*5*1*20)$  
implicit = $9*13*16*12*9*3*9*20$
