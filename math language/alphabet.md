# alphabet
the math language is party english-encoded, so the root words are just english words

a letter corresponds to it's index in the alphabet, so "a" is 1, "b" is 2, etc. for double digit indexes(anything "j" and after) the second digit is a subscript.  
so, 2<sub>6</sub> would be "z"

examples:  
heat = $8512_0$  
implicit = $91_31_61_29392_0$
