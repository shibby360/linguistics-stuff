# verbs
you don't need subject unless it is important to specify who you are talking about, and the verb form doesn't give any extra information.  
verbs are $log_{\text{number of base}}(\text{word})$  

the number of the base is a fraction based on the subject. the number of the perspective is the top, and the bottom is $1$ for singular, and $2$ for plural.

I am running = $log_{\frac{1}{1}}(1_82_11_41_491_47)$
