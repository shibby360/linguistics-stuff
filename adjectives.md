# Adjectives
Adjectives copy the gender of the noun they are describing.  
They always come before the noun.  
Examples:  
**Larege lippi**(Big pillow)  
**Mols compyut**(Small computer)  
Add an "e" at the end to make it feminine. It does not change when there is already an "e" at the end.  
Unlike english, there is no specific order of adjectives.  
If a number is used, then the noun being described is in the Amounting form.
