N makes the "M" sound before p and v. The letter is present just to be present.  
At the end of a word, I, E, and A say their name.
If I, E, or A is present in a "vowel cluster", they say their name, if not in an already registered digraph.  
I, E, and A become r-colored in front of r, put two to make it say it's name.  
Any vowel will say it's name when an apostrophe comes after.  
Letters/Combinations of letters will have a "voicing rank", which goes down at the end of a word. They also have classes, and you use that to identify the sound that comes after.
