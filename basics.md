# Basics
## Nouns
Different nouns in a sentence take different forms, depending on their role.  
These are the noun forms:
+ Standard
+ Possesive
+ Amounting
+ Placed
### Standard
Standard is the "normal" form of a noun.
### Possesive
Possesive is used when showing possesion.  
Converting Standard to Possesive:
| Standard ending | Possesive ending | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a | -e | Mama(mom) => Mame |
| -i | -o | Wati(water) => Wato |
| -(consonant) | -'s | Compyut(computer) => Compyut's |

In a sentence: **Mame mal**(_Mom's boy_)
### Amounting
Use amounting when stating an amount of a noun. Mass nous will obviously not use this form.
| Standard ending | Amounting ending | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a | -u | Papa(dad) => Papu |
| -i | -ak | Lippi(pillow) => Lippak |
| -(consonant) | -s | Khaker(jacket) => Khackers |

In a sentence: **Owt lippak**(_Two pillows_)
### Placed
Placed is used after a preposition indicating space.
| Standard ending | Placed ending | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a | -ad | Mama => Mamad |
| -i | -in | Wati => Watin |

If the noun ends in a consonant, it remains the same.  
In a sentence: **Na rere watin**(_On the water_)
