# Basics
Chhayan does not use articles, but the number one in place for english "a/an"(which is also "a").  
It is declining, so that means nouns change based on where they are in the sentence.  
These are the forms:  
+ **Nominative**: The dictionary form of a noun.
+ **Genitive**: Directly from Wikipedia: "shows generic relationship, generally ownership, but also composition, reference, description, etc."
+ **Objective**: The object of a verb.

Here are the conversion charts(from Nominative)
| Nominative | Genitive |
| --- | --- |
| -k | -c |
| -a | -ē |
| -i | -ā |

| Nominative | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| -t́ | -ś |
| -i | -s |

Anything not covered stays the same. Pronouns do not decline.
## Pronunciation
Every letter is pronounced by itself.  
Examples:  
fimā(f-ee-m-aa) = girl  
āknĭo(aa-k-n-y-o) = window  
kāir(k-aa-ee-r) = car
