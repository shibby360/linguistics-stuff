# Basics
Chhayan does not use articles, but the number one in place for english "a/an"(which is also "a"). It is optional, however. 
Chhayan is declining, so that means nouns change based on where they are in the sentence.  
These are the forms:  
+ **Nominative**: The dictionary form of a noun.
+ **Genitive**: Directly from Wikipedia: "shows generic relationship, generally ownership, but also composition, reference, description, etc."  
The Genitive can be thought of as "of-(noun)", however it is also allowed to be reordered to be though of as "(noun)'s".
+ **Accusative**: The _direct_ object of a verb.

Here are the conversion charts(from Nominative)
| Nominative | Genitive | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a/-ā | -i | fimā => fimi |
| -o/-ē | -u | ākno => āknu |
| zero ending(consonant) | -o | kāir => kāiro |

| Nominative | Accusative | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a | -i | ŭāta => ŭāti |
| -o/-ē | -ā | ākno => āknā |
| zero ending(consonant) | -u | kāir => kāiru |

## Pronunciation
Every letter is pronounced by itself.  
Examples:  
fimā(f-ee-m-aa) = girl  
āknĭo(aa-k-n-y-o) = window  
kāir(k-aa-ee-r) = car  

## Yes and No
`Hāⁿ` = Yes  
`Nē` = No  
`Non` = Not(in verb negation, this comes before the verb)
