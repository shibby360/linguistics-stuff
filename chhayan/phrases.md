## Shortening
When writing pronouns with "het", and the pronoun ends with a vowel, you can shorten it to one word and remove the last letter of the pronoun and the "h" in "het".  
Example:  
`Ĭet` = I am  
You can also remove the "het" entirely, it is optional. Neither of these are used in this course, yet prefectly valid in the language.
