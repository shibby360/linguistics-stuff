# Gender
Chhayan uses grammatical gender, only for nouns, and copied by adjectives.  
Here is the chart for figuring out the gender of a noun:
| Ending | Gender |
| --- | --- |
| -a/-ā | Feminine |
| -o/-ē(words cannot end with -e) | Neutral |
| anything else | Masculine |

Nouns do not change gender when changing cases, so these endings are only for Nominative. If you are refering to a *person*, use that gender instead.
## Possesives
"My/Mine" is `Mom`.  
"Your/Yours" is `Tom`.  
"His" is `Onēm`.  
"Her/Hers" is `Ānem`.  
"Our/Ours" is `Naśom`.  
"Their/Theirs" is `Imíom`.  
These are all given assuming that the noun they will describe is neutral, so change them if needed.
