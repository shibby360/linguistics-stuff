# Alphabet
The Chhayan alphabet is similar to the Latin alphabet, but it is reordered and some letters are eliminated.  
For consonant sounds that can be held indefinitely, the name is created by adding "e"(as in "pet") to the beginning of it. For plosives(stops), the sound is created by adding "ay"(as in "pay") to the end. "H" also takes "ay".  
It goes like this:
| Letter | Sound(english) |
| --- | --- |
| K k | «k» |
| X x | Scottish english's lo<ins>ch</ins>, a.k.a unvoiced velar fricative. |
| Q q | Uvular k. |
| C c | «ch» |
| T t | «t» |
| P p | «p» |
| F f | «f» |
| S s | «s» |
| H h | «h» |
| R R | «r» |
| L l | «l» |
| M m | «m» |
| N n | «ny», palatal nasal |

The only diacritics on consonants are acute accent, grave accent, and circumflex accent, with their uses shown below.
| Accent | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Ḱ | «g» |
| X́ | voiced velar fricative |
| Q́ | Uvular g |
| Ć | «j» |
| T́ | «d» |
| T̀ | «th» |
| T̂ | other «th» as in broTHer |
| Ṕ | «b» |
| F́ | «v» |
| Ś | «z» |
| S̀ | «sh» |
| Ŝ | «zh» |
| R̀ | This does not have any english equivalent. It is like the _tt_ in _bu**tt**er_, but trilled. IPA: ɽ, Hindi: ड़|

Notice only consonants are shown, this becuase vowels are written seperately when writing the alphabet. Accent marks are also used on vowels as well. The name of a vowel is simply its sound.   
**Vowels with accent marks shown here are not written in the alphabet!**
| Vowel | Sound(english) |
| --- | --- |
| A a | c<ins>u</ins>t |
| ā | f<ins>a</ins>r |
| ă | p<ins>o</ins>t |
| E e | p<ins>e</ins>t |
| ē | f<ins>a</ins>te |
| è | c<ins>a</ins>t
| I i | f<ins>ee</ins>t |
| ĭ | <ins>y</ins>ak |
| O o | s<ins>oa</ins>p |
| U u | m<ins>oo</ins>n |
| ŭ | <ins>w</ins>ar |

"a" become r-colored before "r"(er/ur/ir).  
"e" makes the "air" sound.  
"N" changes to the nasal it needs to for the consonant right after. It is dental nasal the end of a word, and palatal before a vowel.
"J" and "V" are variants of "I" and "U", respectively, meaning they can be used interchangeably.  
Words cannot end with plain "e", but the can still end with "eh" sound with `āĭ`.

## Āpat̀rofē
The `āpat̀rofē`(apostrophe) after an i makes it a short i sound, and after u makes it an "uh" with rounded lips. They both become r-colored before r.

## Double letters
Double letters are geminated.

## Nasalization
Add a combining tilde " ̃" to nasalize the vowel.
