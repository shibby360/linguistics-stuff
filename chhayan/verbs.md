# Verbs
There are no irregular verbs.  
All verbs are the same in each form. However, there are times when you will need verb endings.   
Example verb chart for āk het(to be):
| | One person | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | het | het |
| 2nd person | het | het |
| 3rd person | het | het |

Imperative and subjunctive are the stem.  
When suggesting something(let's), use -son.  
When suggesting something(let me), use -aĭē.  
Let him/her are almost the same, -pus(ā). Add the ā if it is "let her".  
Let them is -ruć.  
Gerunds are formed via -ḱani.  
`Ĭa het pilḱani` = I am playing.
## Past tense
To put a verb in past tense, add -ŭā(m/s/ā/i) to the end.  
`Ĭa pilŭās` = I played(as a male).  
The ending depends on the gender/number of the subject, and follows and adjectival pattern.
## Future tense
Future tense is created by -f́iā.  
`Ĭa pilf́iā` = I will play.
## Special Verbs
to air vent = `āk ārf́ent`  
to jump off a swing = `āk ćŭinḱ`
## Modal Verbs(can, should, etc.)
These verbs stay the same, and use the stem of the verb after.  
`Ĭa śul pil af́iek sē...` = I should play with them...
## Fērif́ērṕs(Do verbs)
`Fērif́ērṕs`, which literally means "Do verbs", are verbs that combine a word with `āk fēri` to create a new verb.  
In the infinitive, they come after the verb, but when `fēri` is conjugated, they come before the `fēri`.  
Examples:  
`Ĭa het kharc fēriḱani.` = I am spending.  
`Ĭa khot āk fēri cit.` = I want to read.
## Reflexive
The reflexive pronoun is the same for all subjects, it is always "sĭa".  
Examples:  
`Ĭa sĭa mat̂ātŭās.` = I helped myself.
## Choice - subject or no subject?
You have a choice on whether or not you want to include the subject, however, when the subject is not present, there are seperate verb endings.
| | One person | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | -ē | -onē |
| 2nd person | -ā | -onā |
| 3rd person | -ēā | -onēā |

If it is obvious who you are talking about, then you do not need to add the ending. For fērif́ērṕs, the fēri gets conjugated.
