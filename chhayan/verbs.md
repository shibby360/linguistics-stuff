# Verbs
There are no irregular verbs.  
All verbs are the same in each form.  
Example verb chart for āk het(to be):
| | One person | Two people |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | het | het |
| 2nd person | het | het |
| 3rd person | het | het |

So, verbs are pretty simple.  
Imperative and subjunctive are the stem.  
Gerunds are formed via -ḱani.  
`Ĭa het pilḱani` = I am playing.
## Past tense
To put a verb in past tense, add -ŭās to the end.  
`Ĭa pilŭās` = I played.
## Future tense
Future tense is created by -f́iā.  
`Ĭa pilf́iā` = I will play.
## Special Verbs
to air vent = `āk ārf́ent`  
to jump off a swing = `āk ćŭinḱ`
## Modal Verbs(can, should, etc.)
These verbs stay the same, and use the stem of the verb after.  
`Ĭa śul pil af́iek sē...` = I should play with them...
