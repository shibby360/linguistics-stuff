# Countries
All country names end with "-t̂ēs̀".  
The language of that country is the same, but "t̂ēs̀" replaced with "ski".  
That is also the nationality of the country.  
Some country **stems** are:
+ `Amerik`(America)
+ `Ćāpon`(Japan)
+ `Ānḱlē`(England)
+ `Friānk`(France)
+ `Ŝiērmāl`(Germany)
+ `Int́i`(India)
+ `Kanāt́`(Canada)

The stems are listed in the dictionary.

`Int́i` is a bit irregular. The country name is normal, however, since India does not have one language that the entire country speaks(maybe Hindi though), there are names for each of the languages spoken. Here are a few:
+ `Int́iski`(Hindi)
+ `Tiliḱu`(Telegu)
+ `T̀āmil`(Tamil)
+ `Merāthi`(Marathi)
+ `Panŝāf́i`(Punjabi)
+ `Ḱućurati`(Gujrati)
+ `Mālĭām`(Malayalam)

## I am of someplace
To say you are from somewhere, you say "I am of ...".  
Example:  
`Ĭa het Ćāpont̂ēs̀o.` = I am from Japan.
