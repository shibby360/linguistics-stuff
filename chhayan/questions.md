# Questions
Questions are formed by flipping the subject and the verb.  
Open-ended questions' interrogative expression comes at the end of a question.  
Examples:  
`Het tu ṕos?` = Are you OK?(to a male)  
`Het tu fēriḱani kē?` = What are you doing?  
Other question words are:  
`Kt́ē` = Where  
`Kf́āro` = Who  
`Kĭun` = Why   
`Kaṕ` = When  
`Kamo` = How  
`Komśa` = Which  
"Whose" shows possesion, so `Kf́āro` is in the Genitive for "Whose".  
In Chhayan, there is no "Whom", it is just `Kf́āro`.
