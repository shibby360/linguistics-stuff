# Questions
Yes/No questions are formed by flipping the subject and the verb.  
Open-ended questions' interrogative expression comes at the end of a question.  
Examples:  
`Het tu ṕos?` = Are you good?(to a male)  
`Fēri tu kē?` = What are you doing?  
Other question words are:  
`Kt́ē` = Where  
`Ki` = Who  
`Kĭun` = Why   
`Kaṕ` = When  
`Kamo` = How  
`Komśa` = Which  
All these words decline as needed in a sentence. "Whose" shows possesion, so "Who" is in the Genitive for "Whose".
