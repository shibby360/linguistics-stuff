# Time
Time is represented just like in America, and spoken the same way as well. "o'clock" is not present.  
Example Conversation:
```
Quech teem hetih lio?
Rer teem hetih vif.
```
Translation:
```
What time is it?
The time is 5 o'clock.
```
In english it is sometimes said "it's", but here the time is always said by "The time is".
